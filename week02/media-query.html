            <h2>Mosiah 2: 41</h2>
            <p>41 And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep
                the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if
                they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in
                a state of never-ending happiness. O remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord God
                hath spoken it.</p>

            <h2>3 Nephi 18: 22-24</h2>
            <p>22 And behold, ye shall meet together oft; and ye shall not forbid any man from coming unto you when ye
                shall meet together, but suffer them that they may come unto you and forbid them not;

                23 But ye shall pray for them, and shall not cast them out; and if it so be that they come unto you oft
                ye shall pray for them unto the Father, in my name.

                24 Therefore, hold up your light that it may shine unto the world. Behold I am the light which ye shall
                hold upâ€”that which ye have seen me do. Behold ye see that I have prayed unto the Father, and ye all have
                witnessed.</p>
